# Predict whether a cab booking will get cancelled

## Business Context
The business problem tackled here is trying to improve customer service for YourCabs.com, a cab company in Bangalore. The problem of interest is booking cancellations by the company due to unavailability of a car. The challenge is that cancellations can occur very close to the trip start time, thereby causing passengers inconvenience.

## Competition Goal
The goal of the competition is to create a predictive model for classifying new bookings as to whether they will eventually get cancelled due to car unavailability. This is a classification task that includes misclassification costs. The winning entry will be the one with the lowest average-cost-per-booking.
Participants need to upload their classifications (0=no cancellation or 1=cancellation), and the system will compute the average-cost-per-booking based on these classifications.
